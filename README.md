# -AI-Chrome-Extension

For this project, I built a Chrome Extension that enables autocomplete for text fields on any website. Imagine you are writing a blog, filling out a form, or writing anything on a website, and you have an AI copilot to suggest completions for all the text you write, similar to what Cursor does with code.
